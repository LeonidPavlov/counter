programm is a part of another and have limited functionality
it create date time instanse from date picker


tested in ubuntu 20.04

minimun required python 3.3 (documentation for venv)

inside directory date_time_chooser run script ./adjuster.sh

it's do next:

install python3 venv

install pytest in venv

run tests

install pyinstaller

create runnable file chooser in directory dist

run chooser runnable file

for other operating systems need to use modifications 
of same commands as in file  adjuster.sh maybe
